  "header": "AI hype cycles represent the recurring pattern of enthusiasm, disillusionment, and eventual productive applications that has characterized artificial intelligence throughout its history. Since the field's inception in the 1950s, AI has experienced multiple waves of intense excitement followed by periods dubbed \"AI winters,\" when funding and interest diminished after technologies failed to meet inflated expectations. The first major cycle began with the field's founding and early symbolic approaches, peaking with optimistic predictions before declining in the 1970s when progress stalled. A second wave rose in the 1980s with expert systems, again followed by diminished support when commercial applications proved limited. The current wave, driven by deep learning breakthroughs since 2012, has generated unprecedented investment and public attention, though questions remain about whether expectations again exceed near-term possibilities.\n\nUnderstanding these historical patterns provides valuable context for interpreting current AI developments. While today's neural network approaches have delivered remarkable practical achievements—from computer vision to language models—some argue we're approaching another peak of inflated expectations, particularly regarding artificial general intelligence. Others contend that fundamental differences, including massive private investment, practical commercial applications, and genuine technical breakthroughs, suggest the current cycle is more sustainable. The challenge for researchers, investors, policymakers, and the public is distinguishing between genuine capabilities, legitimate future possibilities, and overestimated claims. This balance of excitement and skepticism helps separate revolutionary advances from incremental progress, guiding responsible investment and application of AI technologies.",
