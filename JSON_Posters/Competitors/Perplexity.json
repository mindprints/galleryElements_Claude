  "header": "Perplexity AI has rapidly established itself as an innovative leader in AI-powered search and knowledge discovery, combining foundation models with real-time data retrieval to create a new paradigm for information access. Founded in 2022, the company has quickly gained prominence by reimagining search as a conversational experience that provides direct, sourced answers rather than just links to potentially relevant web pages.\n\nPerplexity's AI portfolio centers around the Sonar family of models designed for information retrieval and synthesis. Key offerings include:\n\n• Sonar: Core model combining search capabilities with natural language generation\n• Sonar-Pro: Enhanced model with improved reasoning and knowledge integration\n• Sonar-Deep-Research: Specialized model for comprehensive academic and technical research\n• Sonar-Reasoning: Model optimized for logical deduction and problem-solving\n• Sonar-Reasoning-Pro: Advanced reasoning capabilities with extensive knowledge integration\n\nPerplexity's approach differs from traditional AI companies by focusing specifically on the knowledge discovery and information synthesis problem, rather than building general-purpose assistants. The company's technology combines retrieval-augmented generation with real-time data sources to provide up-to-date, factual responses with clear attribution. As an AI-native search company, Perplexity represents a potential disruption to traditional search engines by offering a more direct path from question to answer, with a conversational interface that maintains context across complex information-seeking journeys.",
