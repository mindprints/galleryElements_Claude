    "text": "John McCarthy (1927-2011) was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist who was one of the most influential figures in the history of artificial intelligence. He coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in his proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which is widely considered the birth event of AI as a field. McCarthy made fundamental contributions to AI, including the development of the Lisp programming language family, which became a standard language for AI research for decades.\n\nMcCarthy championed the logic-based approach to AI (symbolic AI) and introduced concepts like time-sharing in computing. He founded the Stanford AI Laboratory (SAIL) in 1962, making it another major center for AI innovation. His work focused on using mathematical logic for representing knowledge and reasoning. McCarthy received the Turing Award in 1971 for his major contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence. His vision and technical innovations shaped the goals and methods of AI research throughout its formative decades."
