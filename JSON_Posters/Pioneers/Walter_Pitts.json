    "text": "Walter Pitts (1923-1969) was an American logician and cognitive scientist who made seminal contributions to computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence despite a challenging life and lack of formal higher education. A largely self-taught prodigy, Pitts collaborated with Warren McCulloch at the University of Chicago.\n\nTheir landmark 1943 paper, \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity,\" introduced the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model. This mathematical model demonstrated how networks of simple, neuron-like elements could perform logical operations and computations, providing a crucial theoretical link between neurobiology and computation. This work formed the basis for early neural network research and connectionism. Later, Pitts worked with Norbert Wiener at MIT, contributing to the foundations of cybernetics. Despite his brilliance, Pitts struggled personally and professionally later in life, and his immense early contributions were sometimes overlooked."
