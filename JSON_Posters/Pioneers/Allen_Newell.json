    "text": "Allen Newell (1927-1992) was an American researcher in computer science and cognitive psychology at the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University. He was a foundational figure in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Collaborating closely with Herbert A. Simon, Newell developed the Logic Theorist (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS, 1957), early programs that aimed to simulate human problem-solving techniques.\n\nNewell's work emphasized symbolic computation and information processing as models for human cognition. He contributed significantly to the development of list processing languages (IPL) and the understanding of human-computer interaction. With Simon and Clifford Shaw, he established the viability of heuristic programming. Newell was a key proponent of unified theories of cognition, culminating in his Soar architecture, an attempt to model all aspects of human cognition within a single framework. He received the Turing Award jointly with Herbert Simon in 1975 for their fundamental contributions to AI and the psychology of human cognition."
