    "text": "Claude Shannon (1916-2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as \"the father of information theory.\" His groundbreaking 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\" established the field of information theory and introduced the concept of the \"bit\" as a unit of digital information. Shannon's work laid the mathematical foundation for digital communications and storage that power today's information age. At Bell Labs and later MIT, Shannon also made fundamental contributions to cryptography, artificial intelligence, and computer science.\n\nBeyond his theoretical achievements, Shannon was an inventor and tinkerer who created numerous mechanical and electronic devices, including early chess-playing machines, a mind-reading machine, a flame-throwing trumpet, and a mechanical mouse that could solve mazes. His work on game theory and machine learning included one of the first programs for computer chess. His playful approach to complex problems exemplified his belief that intellectual curiosity should be guided by enjoyment. Shannon's mathematical framework for understanding information continues to underpin all digital technology, from smartphones to the internet, making him one of the most influential figures in the development of our modern digital world."
