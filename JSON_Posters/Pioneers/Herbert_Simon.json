    "text": "Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001) was an American scientist whose work spanned economics, cognitive psychology, computer science, and artificial intelligence. A true polymath, Simon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 for his pioneering research on decision-making within organizations. His concept of \"bounded rationality\" challenged classical economic theory by recognizing that humans make decisions with limited information, cognitive capacity, and time. This insight became fundamental to behavioral economics and AI systems design.\n\nIn the field of artificial intelligence, Simon was a towering figure who helped establish the field as a scientific discipline. With Allen Newell, he created the Logic Theorist in 1956, widely considered the first AI program. Their General Problem Solver (GPS) program followed, demonstrating how computers could approach problems using means-end analysis similar to human problem-solving. Simon coined the term \"satisficing\" to describe decision-making that seeks satisfactory rather than optimal solutions—a concept that influenced both AI design and organizational theory. As a professor at Carnegie Mellon University for over five decades, Simon helped establish one of the world's premier computer science and AI research centers, mentoring generations of scientists who continue to advance the fields he helped create."
