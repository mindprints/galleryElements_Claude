    "text": "Arthur Samuel (1901-1990) was an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. While working at IBM, he developed one of the world's first self-learning programs, a checkers-playing program created in the 1950s. Samuel is credited with popularizing the term \"machine learning\" in a 1959 paper.\n\nHis checkers program was notable because it learned to play the game significantly better than Samuel himself. It achieved this through techniques like alpha-beta pruning and, crucially, by adjusting its parameters based on observing game outcomes (learning from experience). The program demonstrated that a machine could learn complex strategies without explicit programming for every possible scenario. Samuel's work provided early, compelling evidence that computers could be programmed to learn and improve, significantly influencing subsequent research in machine learning and AI."
