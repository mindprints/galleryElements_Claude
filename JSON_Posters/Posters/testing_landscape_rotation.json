    "text": "Our carousel stage displays selected categories of posters in a rotating circle. When a poster is front and center, its border turns orange to indicate that it is selectable. Selecting the poster causes it to rotate and enlarge, revealing text, images, and other content on its backside. This system has been functioning well, and we have updated all posters to v2. Given this success, we decided to rotate these selected backsides so that the information they contain is presented in a landscape format, allowing us to better utilize screen space.\n\n\nAll of this is accomplished through intricate CSS and is working as expected. The only problem is that our posters are still formatted for portrait orientation. As a result, they are all currently \"lying on their sides\"—as seen in the screenshot. Our template for poster backsides needs to facilitate landscape rendering. We have a screenshot of approximately how that should look (second screenshot), and while the current CSS for the backsides matches our styling and meets our expectations, it just needs to be adapted for landscape orientation.",
