The company's AI strategy balances commercial applications across its social platforms with substantial contributions to the broader AI ecosystem through its open model releases, research publications, and developer tools.\n\nMeta's AI portfolio is anchored by the Llama family of large language models, which have become industry standards for open-source AI development. Key models include:\n\n• Llama 3.2: The latest advanced open-source LLM with enhanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities\n• Llama 3 (7B, 13B, 70B): A family of foundation models with varying parameter sizes for different deployment scenarios\n• Code Llama: Specialized model for code generation and programming assistance\n\nBeyond language models, Meta's AI research spans computer vision, multimodal learning, speech recognition, and responsible AI development. The company's commitment to open science is reflected in its research publications and model releases, which have accelerated progress across the industry. Through its integration of AI technologies across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and its metaverse initiatives, Meta continues to demonstrate how foundation models can enhance social experiences, creativity tools, and human-computer interaction paradigms."
