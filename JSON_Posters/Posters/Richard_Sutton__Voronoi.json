    "text": "Richard S. Sutton is a Canadian computer scientist widely regarded as one of the founders of modern reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence focused on learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties. He is a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta and a fellow and Chief Scientific Advisor at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), where he has helped shape both theory and practice in machine learning. Sutton co-authored the influential textbook Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction with Andrew Barto and introduced key ideas such as temporal-difference learning, the Dyna architecture, and actor-critic (policy gradient) methods, which underpin many contemporary AI systems. In recognition of his foundational contributions, he received the 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award together with Barto for developing the conceptual and algorithmic basis of reinforcement learning that now powers applications from game-playing systems to robotics and large-scale decision-making algorithms.",
