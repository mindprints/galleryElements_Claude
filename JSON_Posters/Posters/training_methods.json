    "text": "AI training methods encompass the diverse techniques and algorithms used to develop artificial intelligence systems capable of performing complex tasks. These methods have evolved from simple supervised learning approaches, where models learn from labeled examples, to sophisticated multi-stage training pipelines that combine multiple learning paradigms. Contemporary AI training often begins with pre-training on massive datasets using self-supervised learning, where models learn general representations without human-provided labels by predicting parts of their input data. This foundation is then refined through fine-tuning on specific tasks, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences, and various techniques to improve safety, reduce bias, and enhance capabilities in targeted domains.\n\nThe technical aspects of AI training have grown increasingly complex, involving distributed computing across thousands of specialized processors, sophisticated optimization techniques, and careful management of enormous datasets. Innovations such as transfer learning enable knowledge gained from one task to accelerate learning in related domains, while curriculum learning gradually increases task difficulty to improve final performance. Methods like contrastive learning help models distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples, while techniques such as distillation compress knowledge from larger models into more efficient ones. As AI systems become more capable, training approaches continue to evolve, with increasing emphasis on data quality over quantity, more efficient use of computational resources, and techniques that promote alignment with human values and intentions."
