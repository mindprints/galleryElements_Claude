    "text": "GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) represents a family of large language models developed by OpenAI that have revolutionized natural language processing. The architecture builds on the transformer model, employing a decoder-only approach that predicts the next token based on previous context. What began with GPT-1 in 2018 has evolved through multiple iterations with exponentially increasing parameters and capabilities.\n\nGPT models are trained using unsupervised learning on massive text corpora from the internet, books, and various other sources. Each successive version has demonstrated remarkable improvements in language understanding, generation quality, and the ability to follow instructions. The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 marked a turning point in AI accessibility, bringing powerful language models to the general public and sparking both enthusiasm and concerns about AI capabilities. GPT's impact extends across industries, from content creation and programming assistance to education and healthcare, fundamentally changing how humans interact with AI systems."
