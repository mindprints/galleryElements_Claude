    "text": "Frank Rosenblatt (1928-1971) was an American psychologist notable for his pioneering work in artificial neural networks. Working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in the late 1950s, Rosenblatt created the Perceptron, one of the earliest artificial neural networks and a foundational algorithm for supervised learning. He built hardware implementations of the Perceptron, such as the Mark I Perceptron, which could learn to recognize patterns.\n\nRosenblatt's work generated significant excitement and optimism about the potential of connectionist approaches to AI, demonstrating machines that could learn from experience. However, his ambitious claims were later challenged, notably in the 1969 book \"Perceptrons\" by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, which highlighted the limitations of single-layer perceptrons (e.g., their inability to solve the XOR problem). This critique contributed to a decline in neural network research funding (the first \"AI winter\"). Despite this, Rosenblatt's Perceptron algorithm remains a fundamental concept in machine learning, and his work laid the groundwork for later developments in multi-layer neural networks.",
