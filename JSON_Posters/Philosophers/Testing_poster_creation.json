Published on January 29, 2025, this report reinforces the principle that human authorship is essential for copyright protection under U.S. law. Below are the key points from the report:\n\nHuman Authorship as a Core Requirement\nWorks entirely generated by AI without meaningful human input are not eligible for copyright protection. This aligns with long-standing principles of U.S. copyright law, which protect only original works created by humans.",
