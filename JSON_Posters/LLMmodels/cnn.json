    "text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionized computer vision by introducing an architecture specifically designed to process grid-like data such as images. Inspired by the visual cortex of animals, CNNs use convolutional layers that apply learnable filters across the input, enabling the network to automatically detect spatial hierarchies of features from low-level patterns to high-level concepts.\n\nThe key innovations of CNNs include weight sharing (using the same filter weights across the entire input), local connectivity (each neuron connected to only a small region of the input), and pooling operations that reduce dimensionality while retaining important information. These principles allow CNNs to be translation invariant and to effectively capture the 2D structure of images. While initially transformative for image classification, object detection, and segmentation, CNNs have expanded beyond computer vision to fields like natural language processing, speech recognition, and even genomics. The development of influential architectures like AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet dramatically advanced the state-of-the-art in visual recognition tasks and helped catalyze the deep learning revolution across multiple domains."
