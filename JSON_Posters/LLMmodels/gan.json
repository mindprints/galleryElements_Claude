    "text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014, represent a revolutionary approach to generative modeling through an adversarial process. GANs consist of two neural networks—a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated samples—trained simultaneously in a minimax game where each network attempts to outperform the other.\n\nThis adversarial training framework allows GANs to learn complex, high-dimensional data distributions without explicitly modeling them, enabling the generation of remarkably realistic images, text, audio, and other media. The innovation of GANs lies in their ability to learn through competition rather than direct optimization of a single objective, effectively leveraging the discriminator as a learned loss function for the generator. Since their introduction, numerous GAN variants have emerged to address challenges like training instability and mode collapse, including DCGANs, CGANs, StyleGAN, and CycleGAN. These architectures have enabled unprecedented applications in image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation, domain adaptation, and even drug discovery, fundamentally changing how we approach generative modeling across multiple domains."
