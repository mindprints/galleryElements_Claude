    "text": "Logic provides the formal foundation upon which much of artificial intelligence was built, offering precise languages and inference mechanisms for representing and reasoning about knowledge. The evolution of logic for AI began with classical propositional and first-order predicate logic, which enabled the representation of facts and rules about the world using symbols and formal syntax. These logical systems were extended to address the needs of artificial intelligence, leading to specialized formalisms like modal logic (for reasoning about necessity and possibility), temporal logic (for capturing time-dependent information), description logics (optimized for classification hierarchies), and non-monotonic logics (allowing conclusions to be retracted when new information arrives). Logic programming languages like Prolog implemented these principles computationally, enabling automated theorem proving, expert systems, and knowledge-based AI throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWhile symbolic logic dominated early AI, its limitations in handling uncertainty, learning from data, and scaling to real-world complexity led to its partial eclipse by statistical and neural approaches. However, logic continues to play vital roles in modern artificial intelligence. Knowledge graphs and ontologies, semantic web technologies, and explainable AI all draw from logical foundations. Even in the era of deep learning, researchers are exploring neuro-symbolic systems that combine neural networks' pattern recognition capabilities with logic's explicit reasoning. Formal verification of AI systems relies on logical methods to prove properties about neural networks and other complex models. As AI systems are increasingly deployed in critical applications, logic provides tools for transparency, interpretability, and verification—ensuring that artificial intelligence can be trustworthy, explainable, and aligned with human goals and values."
