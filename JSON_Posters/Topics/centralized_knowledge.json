    "text": "Centralized knowledge approaches in artificial intelligence represent systematic efforts to capture human expertise and factual information in structured, machine-readable formats that AI systems can reason with. Beginning with early expert systems in the 1970s and 1980s, researchers developed formal knowledge bases like Cyc, WordNet, and later, the Semantic Web, which aimed to encode comprehensive world knowledge using logical representations, ontologies, and semantic networks. These structured repositories enabled symbolic AI systems to perform inference, planning, and question-answering by explicitly modeling entities, concepts, relationships, and rules. The centralized knowledge paradigm reached its apex with IBM Watson's victory in Jeopardy!, demonstrating how massive curated knowledge bases could power sophisticated question-answering capabilities through explicit reasoning over facts.\n\nWhile centralized knowledge bases offer advantages in interpretability, logical coherence, and explicit reasoning, they face significant challenges that have shifted AI development toward more distributed, emergent approaches. The manual effort required to construct and maintain these resources proved prohibitively expensive and difficult to scale—Doug Lenat's Cyc project spent decades encoding common-sense knowledge without achieving general intelligence. Knowledge bases struggle with context-sensitivity, ambiguity, and the fluid, evolving nature of human knowledge. \n\nContemporary AI systems increasingly rely on implicit knowledge learned through neural networks trained on vast corpora, where facts and relationships emerge statistically rather than being explicitly encoded. Modern approaches often combine these paradigms, with large language models implicitly capturing world knowledge while being augmented with retrieval mechanisms that access external, structured information sources, creating hybrid systems that benefit from both the flexibility of learned representations and the precision of explicit knowledge."
