            Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, held in 1956, is widely regarded as the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field. This seminal workshop lasted approximately six weeks and was essentially an extended brainstorming session. Organized by John McCarthy, the project brought together leading mathematicians and scientists, including Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, who proposed the workshop.

            The Logic Theorist, created in 1956 by Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Cliff Shaw, was the first program deliberately engineered to mimic human problem-solving skills. It successfully proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica, and in some cases, found new and more elegant proofs than those originally proposed.

            In 1950, Alan Turing published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which proposed a test for machine intelligence. The Turing Test, as it became known, suggests that if a computer can engage in conversation so convincingly that humans cannot distinguish it from a human participant, it has demonstrated intelligence.

            ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT between 1964 and 1966, was one of the first chatterbots. By simulating a psychotherapist's behavior through pattern matching and response selection, ELIZA demonstrated how machines could engage in apparently meaningful dialogue while having no understanding of the conversation.

            In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue made history by defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. This landmark victory marked the first time a computer beat a reigning world champion under standard chess tournament time controls, demonstrating that machines could outperform humans in specific intellectual tasks.
